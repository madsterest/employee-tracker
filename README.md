# Description

This app provides an easy way to interact with a MySQL database.
Especially for large businesses, it is easy to lose track of your employees, roles and departments. Without being very familiar with databse technology, it can be difficult to find a system of storing data that is accessible.
This program allows the user to easily Create, Update, View and Delete data from three business related categories, employees, roles and departments.
